# Turkish LLM Math Performance Enhancement

> This project enhances Turkish LLM math reasoning using Reinforcement Learning (RL). It focuses on improving step-by-step problem-solving and final answer accuracy in mathematical domains.

The core approach involves fine-tuning Turkish language models on mathematical reasoning datasets. A key element is 
training the model to adhere to explicit reasoning steps (`<think>`) followed by a final answer (`<answer>...#### number</answer>`). 
This structure facilitates programmatic reward calculation based on both format adherence and numerical accuracy.

Key components (current focus):
- **Model:** `ytu-ce-cosmos/Turkish-Llama-8b-Instruct-v0.1`
- **Technique:** GRPO (via `trl.GRPOTrainer`, includes custom trainer for EOS handling)
- **Datasets:** `malhajar/gsm8k-tr`
- **Format:** Structured reasoning output (e.g., `<think>`/`<answer>`) with marked final numerical result.
- **Libraries:** `transformers`, `peft`, `trl`, `bitsandbytes`, `datasets`.
